## For Developers (You and Me):

1. `Create a QuickBooks Online Account`: You need to have your own QuickBooks Online account. This is where you'll set up your application and obtain API credentials.

2. `Register Your Application`: Register your application with Intuit Developer and obtain the necessary API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret). You will also set up the Redirect URI for handling OAuth callbacks.

3. `Understand OAuth 2.0`: Familiarize yourself with the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow, as you will be using it to connect users' QuickBooks Online accounts to your application.

4. `Implement OAuth Flow`: Develop the logic in your application to initiate the OAuth flow, redirect users to QuickBooks Online for authorization, and handle the callback to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

## For Users(clients)

1. `QuickBooks Online Account`: Users must have an active QuickBooks Online account. They can sign up for one if they don't have it already.

2. `Administrator` Access: Users should have administrator or accountant-level access to their QuickBooks Online account, as some API operations require higher-level permissions.

3. `Consent`: Users will be prompted to grant your application permission to access their QuickBooks Online data during the OAuth authorization process. They need to consent to this access.

4. `Access Token`: After successfully connecting their QuickBooks Online account to your application, users will receive an access token. This token grants your application permission to make API requests on their behalf.

5. `Realm ID`: Users will also have a realm ID associated with their QuickBooks Online company. This realm ID is unique to each company and is needed to specify which company's data your application should access.

6. `API Scope`: Users should be aware of the specific permissions and data access your application requires, as defined by the API scopes you request during the OAuth flow.

7. `Billing and Subscription`: Depending on your application's functionality, users may need to ensure they have an appropriate QuickBooks Online subscription that supports the features your app provides.

8. `Internet Access`: Users should have access to the internet to complete the OAuth flow and interact with your application.

9. Once you and your users have met these requirements, you can guide them through the OAuth authorization process, obtain their consent, and start making API requests on their behalf to integrate with their QuickBooks Online data.

## What can SDK (OAuth) do?

1. `Access to Company Data`: Once authorized, third-party applications can access and retrieve a wide range of data from a user's QuickBooks Online company, including financial data, customer information, vendor data, and more.

2. `Data Modification`: Authorized applications can `create`, `update`, and `delete` records within a user's QuickBooks Online company. For example, they can `create invoices`, `manage expenses`, and `update` customer information.

3. `Accounting Operations`: QuickBooks OAuth enables applications to perform accounting operations, such as creating and managing invoices, bills, expenses, and transactions.

4. `Reporting` Authorized applications can retrieve financial reports and summaries, helping users gain insights into their business finances.
